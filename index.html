    <p class="ptext">As you can properly see, Molly DeWolf Swenson is no<iframe id="sol-vid" align="right" width="400px" height="230px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDwulYcboDU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> ordinary woman and my fan-crush on her is not without some reasoning behind it. Not only does she have a CV, unlike anything we have ever seen before, she also has a heart for humanitarian work. Her thought behind RYOT was to develop a media to show the "behind the scenes" of the worst situation from around the world. This was not an easy task an it took a long time before the first project video was done - but boy was it done! It was called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDwulYcboDU&feature=youtu.be" alt="Solitary Confinement" target="_blank">Solitary Confinement</a> and showed the inhumain situations inmates in isolation faces. It gave the unic insightment of how small confinments the inmates faces in isolation, by putting on the VR glasses an being there yourself. It was a huge succes and quickly formed the future of the company. They decided to help non-profit organisation raise money through 360&deg; VR videos. It might sound simple, but as with the Solitary Confinement film, it turned out to be a great tool for people sitting at home understanding the great catastrophes of the Ebola outbreak of Africa, the earthquake in Nepal and the war-zones of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxxb_7wzvJI&feature=youtu.be" alt="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>. And now they are advancing, partnering up with google, and creating the first ever world news show in VR - using the Hulu VR app. They will properly change and shape the future of all our news...</p>
    <p class="ptext">Molly DeWolf Swenson dosent have a wikipedia (although I am working on it!) but she does have this awesome video from a TEDx talk in Berlin. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
